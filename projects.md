Blinky is a cloud-controlled, programmable home light display based on
the amazing [Feather HUZZAH32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405)
developer board and [DotStar LED strips](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2241),
both from Adafruit.

# Minecraft lamp

This lamp is based on a design from [John Baichtal](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/4988),
author of [Minecraft for Makers](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920115298.do). It
is a laser-cut plywood box, spraypainted with laser-cut templates. Inside is an RGB LED,
controlled by a nearby control box containing an Arduino with a custom PCB shield and two
pots: one to control the brightness, and another to control the speed of the color
changing effect.

# Laser-cut Acrylic LED lamp

![Theo Lamp](theo-lamp.jpg){:width="40%"}

This was our quickest project -- one day! It is a laser-cut wood base
containing an [RGB LED
strip](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01I1BVIQ4/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
with a remote control. A laser-etched acrylic sheet sits atop the base
and is lit from below.

# Raspberry Pi Day/Night Clock

{:.center}
![Theo clock GIF](theo-clock.gif){:width="40%"}

This is a clock based on a Raspberry Pi mated with a [Pimoroni Unicorn
HAT HD](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3580) 16x16 RGB LED display.
It shows different images depending on the time of day, to help
Sidney's little brother know when he's allowed to get out of bed in
the morning.

* [Python source code on Github](https://github.com/mdwelsh/sidney-projects/tree/master/pi/theoclock)
